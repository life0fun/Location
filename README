handle.js gets the websocket connect, and client.

You can require a module multiple time, each require is a singleton.
Module private data is closed thru closure.

Depends on client type, invoke the following 3 types of client to handle request separately.

Server support 3 types of streaming.

1. stream playback file using PlaybackClient.(node.am.mot.com/ or /playback)
   Each playback client repsents a standalone session to a remote client.
   There is no correlation between clients, no need to keep global list of clients.
   remote sends the file to be stream to server, so needs handleMsg in server.
   remote disconnect, just fine.

2. Realtime streaming client using RealtimeClient(/realtime).
   all remote clients share one instance of Twitter Node with Rest API.
   remote client only listening streaming, no sending.

3. TweetClient for tracking keywords. (node.am.mot.com/droid)
   all remote clients share one instance of TwitterClient.
   remote client only listening streaming, no sending.
   one TwitterNode to get streaming from twitter and relay it to all clients in list.
